## What is Spark and why does it matter for Data Engineers

Data Analysts, data Scientist, Business Intelligence analysts and many other roles require data on demand.
Fighting with data silos, many scatter databases, Excel files, CSV files, JSON files, APIs and  potentially different flavours of cloud storage may be tedious, nerve-wracking
and time-consuming.

Automated process that would follow set of steps, procedures and processes take subsets of data, columns from database, binary files and merged them together to 
serve business needs and potentials is and still will be a favorable job for many organizations and teams.

Spark is an absolute winner for this tasks and a great choice for adoption.

Data Engineering should have the extent and capability to do:

1. System architecture
1. Programming
1. Database design and configuration
1. Interface and sensor configuration


And in addition to that, it is as important as familiarity with the technical tools is, the concepts of data architecture and pipeline design are even more important. The tools are worthless without a solid conceptual understanding of:

1. Data models
1. Relational and non-relational database design
1. Information flow
1. Query execution and optimization
1. Comparative analysis of data stores
1. Logical operations

Apache Spark have all the technology built-in to cover these topics and has the capacity for achieving a concrete goal for assembling together functional systems to do the goal.
