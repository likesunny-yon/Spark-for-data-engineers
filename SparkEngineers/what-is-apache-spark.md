# What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Originally it was developed at the Berkeley's AMPLab, and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.


Spark is used at a wide range of organizations to process large datasets.
